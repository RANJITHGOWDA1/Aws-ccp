AWS global infrastructure

* Selecting a Region
When determining the right Region for your services, data, and applications, consider the following four business factors.

1.Compliance with data governance and legal requirements:
* Depending on your company and location, you might need to run your data out of specific areas 
2.Proximity to your customers:
* Selecting a Region that is close to your customers will help you to get content to them faster.
3.Available services within a Region:
* Sometimes, the closest Region might not have all the features that you want to offer to customers. 
AWS is frequently innovating by creating new services and expanding on features within existing services.
4.Pricing:

Availability Zones:
* An Availability Zone is a single data center or a group of data centers within a Region. Availability Zones are located tens of miles apart from each other.

Edge locations:
* An edge location is a site that Amazon CloudFront uses to store cached copies of your content closer to your customers for faster delivery.

Ways to interact with AWS services:
1.AWS Management Console:
* The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface for accessing and managing AWS services. 
You can quickly access recently used services and search for other services by name, keyword, or acronym. 

2.AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI):
* To save time when making API requests, you can use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
 AWS CLI enables you to control multiple AWS services directly from the command line within one tool.

3.software development kits (SDKs):
* SDKs make it easier for you to use AWS services through an API designed for your programming language or platform. 
SDKs enable you to use AWS services with your existing applications or create entirely new applications that will run on AWS.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
* With AWS Elastic Beanstalk, you provide code and configuration settings, and Elastic Beanstalk deploys the resources necessary to perform the following tasks:
*Adjust capacity
* Load balancing
* Automatic scaling
* Application health monitoring

AWS CloudFormation:
* With AWS CloudFormation, you can treat your infrastructure as code. 
This means that you can build an environment by writing lines of code instead of using the AWS Management Console to individually provision resources.
* AWS CloudFormation provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner,

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC):
* A networking service that you can use to establish boundaries around your AWS resources is Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
* Amazon VPC enables you to provision an isolated section of the AWS Cloud. In this isolated section, you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define.

* subnet: A subnet is a section of a VPC that can contain resources such as Amazon EC2 instances.
1.Public subnets:
* Public subnets contain resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online storeâ€™s website.
2.Private subnets:
* Private subnets contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network,

Internet gateway:To allow public traffic from the internet to access your VPC, you attach an internet gateway to the VPC.
* An internet gateway is a connection between a VPC and the internet.
*  Without an internet gateway, no one can access the resources within your VPC.

Virtual private gateway:
* To access private resources in a VPC, you can use a virtual private gateway. 
* The virtual private gateway is the component that allows protected internet traffic to enter into the VPC

AWS Direct Connect:
* AWS Direct Connect is a service that enables you to establish a dedicated private connection between your data center and a VPC.
