What is cloud computing?
*Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services

Deployment models for cloud computing:

1.cloud-based deployment:
In a cloud-based deployment model, you can migrate existing applications to the cloud,
or you can design and build new applications in the cloud.
*Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
*Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
*Design and build new applications in the cloud.

2.On-premises deployment: is also known as a private cloud deployment. 
In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.
*Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
*Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.

3.hybrid deployment:
*In a hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. 
You might want to use this approach in a number of situations.
*Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
*Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

Benefits of cloud computing:
* Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
* Increase speed and agility
* Go global in minutes
* Benefit from massive economies of scale

Types of cloud computing:

1.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
*Infrastructure as a Service, sometimes abbreviated as IaaS, contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, 
computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space.

2.Platform as a Service (PaaS):
*Platforms as a service remove the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment 
and management of your applications.

3.Software as a Service (SaaS):
*Software as a Service provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. 
In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications.

Cloud computing with AWS:Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. 
Millions of customers—including the fastest-growing startups, largest enterprises, and leading government agencies—are using AWS to lower costs, become more agile, and innovate faster.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2):
*Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. 
Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front,so you can develop and deploy applications faster.
*By comparison, with an Amazon EC2 instance you can use a virtual server to run applications in the AWS Cloud.

Amazon EC2 instance types:
1.General purpose instances:
* provides a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. You can use them for a variety of workloads, such as:
* application servers
* gaming servers
* backend servers for enterprise applications
* small and medium databases

2.Compute optimized instances:
*Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors. 
Like general purpose instances, you can use compute optimized instances for workloads such as web, application, and gaming servers.

3.Memory optimized instances: are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large datasets in memory. 
In computing, memory is a temporary storage area

4.Accelerated computing instances: use hardware accelerators, or coprocessors, 
to perform some functions more efficiently than is possible in software running on CPUs.

5.Storage optimized instances: are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage.

Amazon EC2 pricing:
* With Amazon EC2, you pay only for the compute time that you use. Amazon EC2 offers a variety of pricing options for different use cases

1.On-Demand: are ideal for short-term
2.Amazon EC2 Savings Plans: 1-year or 3-year term. This term commitment results in savings of up to 66% over On-Demand costs.
3.Reserved Instances:
4.Spot Instances: Spot Instances use unused Amazon EC2 computing capacity and offer you cost savings at up to 90% off of On-Demand prices.
5.Dedicated Hosts: are physical servers with Amazon EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use

Scaling Amazon EC2:

*Scalability: Scalability involves beginning with only the resources you need and designing your architecture to automatically respond to changing demand by 
scaling out or in.As a result, you pay for only the resources you use. 

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling:
* Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling enables you to automatically add or remove Amazon EC2 instances in response to changing application demand. 
By automatically scaling your instances in and out as needed

Elastic Load Balancing:
* Elastic Load Balancing is the AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances. 

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS):
* Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a publish/subscribe service. Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers.

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS):
* Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a message queuing service. 
Using Amazon SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.
* Amazon SQS, an application sends messages into a queue. A user or service retrieves a message from the queue, processes it, and then deletes it from the queue.
